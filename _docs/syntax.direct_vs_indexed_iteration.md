In the code you shared ([../01-books-requests](/01-books-requests/)), you see two types of loops:

1. **`for book in BOOKS:` (direct iteration)** 
2. **`for i in range(len(BOOKS)):` (index-based iteration)**

Both loops have their use cases, but they are chosen based on the specific needs of the operation being performed. Let me explain why and when each is used:

### 1. **Direct Iteration: `for book in BOOKS:`**

This loop is useful when you don't need to modify the list itself but only want to iterate over the elements (in this case, `book`) to perform some operations, like reading or filtering data.

#### Use Case: Read and Filter Operations
For example, in your `GET` requests:

```python
@app.get("/books/")
async def read_category_by_query(category: str):
    books_to_return = []
    for book in BOOKS:
        if book.get('category').casefold() == category.casefold():
            books_to_return.append(book)
    return books_to_return
```

Here, you only care about checking the `category` of each `book` and adding matching books to the `books_to_return` list. You don't need to know the index or change the structure of the list itself, so **direct iteration** (`for book in BOOKS:`) is simpler and more readable.

### 2. **Index-Based Iteration: `for i in range(len(BOOKS)):`**

This loop is useful when you need to modify the list itself or access the index of the elements. By iterating over the range of the list's length, you can directly access and modify elements at a specific index.

#### Use Case: Modify, Update, or Delete Operations
For example, in your `PUT` and `DELETE` operations:

```python
@app.put("/books/update_book")
async def update_book(updated_book=Body()):
    for i in range(len(BOOKS)):
        if BOOKS[i].get('title').casefold() == updated_book.get('title').casefold():
            BOOKS[i] = updated_book
```

Here, you're modifying the `BOOKS` list by updating a book at a specific index. You need the index (`i`) to perform the update operation. Similarly, for deleting a book:

```python
@app.get("/books/delete_book/{book_title}")
async def delete_book(book_title: str):
    for i in range(len(BOOKS)):
        if BOOKS[i].get('title').casefold() == book_title.casefold():
            BOOKS.pop(i)
            break
```

In this case, you also need the index to `pop` (remove) the element from the list. Using `for book in BOOKS:` wouldn't allow you to modify the list directly in place since you wouldn't know which index to remove.

### Summary of When to Use Each Type of Loop:

- **`for book in BOOKS:`** — Use this when you are only reading or filtering elements, and there is no need to modify the list or access the index of elements.
- **`for i in range(len(BOOKS)):`** — Use this when you need the index to modify the list, such as for updating or deleting elements.

Both approaches work fine, but they serve different purposes based on whether you need to modify the list or just read from it.
