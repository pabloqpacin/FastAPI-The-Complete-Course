In Python, there is no strict rule about when to use **single quotes (`'`)** versus **double quotes (`"`)** for defining strings. Both types of quotes work the same way, and it’s largely a matter of style or preference. However, there are a few practical considerations for when to use one over the other:

### 1. **Consistency and Readability (Code Style)**
- It’s a good practice to pick either single or double quotes for the majority of your strings in a project to keep your code consistent and easy to read.
- Python's style guide (PEP 8) doesn’t mandate one or the other, but **consistency** within a project or file is important.

### 2. **Avoiding Escaping**
You should use single or double quotes based on which type of quote appears inside the string itself. This allows you to avoid using backslashes (`\`) to escape characters, making your code cleaner.

- **Use single quotes (`'`) if the string contains double quotes (`"`)**:
    ```python
    quote = 'She said, "Hello!"'
    ```

- **Use double quotes (`"`) if the string contains single quotes (`'`)**:
    ```python
    contraction = "It's a beautiful day."
    ```

If you used the same type of quotes inside and outside the string, you would have to escape the inner quotes, like this:

```python
quote = "She said, \"Hello!\""
contraction = 'It\'s a beautiful day.'
```

But avoiding unnecessary escapes makes the code cleaner and easier to read.

### 3. **Docstrings**
For **multi-line strings** or **docstrings**, Python conventionally uses **triple double quotes (`"""`)**, though you can also use triple single quotes (`'''`). The preference is triple double quotes for consistency with most codebases:

```python
def example_function():
    """This is a docstring example.
    It can span multiple lines.
    """
    pass
```

### 4. **Strings with Both Single and Double Quotes**
If your string contains both single and double quotes, you'll have to escape one of them. In these cases, it's often more convenient to choose whichever quote minimizes the need for escapes:

Example with double quotes:
```python
message = "He said, \"It's amazing!\""
```

Or vice versa:
```python
message = 'He said, "It\'s amazing!"'
```

### Summary of Recommendations:
- **Choose based on content**: Use the opposite quote type to avoid escaping characters.
- **Stay consistent**: If you don’t have a specific reason, pick one style (single or double quotes) and stick with it across your codebase.
- **Docstrings**: Follow the convention of using triple double quotes (`"""`).

In the end, both single and double quotes work the same way, so the choice is mostly about making the code clean and readable.
